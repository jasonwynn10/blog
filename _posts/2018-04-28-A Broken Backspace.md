title: A Broken Backspace
---
I spilled white grape juice on my laptop keyboard. Now, the backspace and delete keys are not functioning properly along with the entire numpad. To make matters worse, when I attempted to remove the backspace key cap, I applied too much force on the center of the key and cracked it in half. Needless to say, I am not happy. Now, I have a sticky, cracked backspace key and a sticky delete key and the innability to backspace. I guess it could be worse though. I was lucky that only a few keys were ruined instead of my whole computer getting fried.
