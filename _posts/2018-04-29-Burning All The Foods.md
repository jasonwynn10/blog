title: Burning All The Foods
---
I’ve got a long history of burning foods that I cook/bake, and when I say I’ve had a bad history of burning foods, I mean it’s really bad. I once was attempting to cook Mac ‘n cheese when I caused a grease fire somehow. The food was burned of course, but since then almost everything I’ve cooked has been burned without any rational cause. I’ve told many people that I’m not trying to burn the food, but most don’t believe me since it happens nearly every time. I really don’t know what to tell them. It just happens, and I don’t know how or why.
