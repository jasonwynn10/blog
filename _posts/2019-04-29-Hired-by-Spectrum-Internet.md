title: Hired by Spectrum internet
---
It's been a while since I posted, but I thought this one was worth it because I was finally hired by a mainstream company! Charter Spectrum (formerly Time Warner Cable) hired me and I will start July 12th. The job will be working the call center, but I think it's good enough for how much it pays and all the benefits I'm getting!
