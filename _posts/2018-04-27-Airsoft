I’ve started taking interest in airsoft. It appears to be a fun sport, and a lot of content can be found on YouTube about it. Silo Entertainment is one Youtuber in particular who I like to watch. He has about 1.2 million subs and does all his videos on airsoft. The primary weapon he uses is an SSG24 airsoft sniper rifle with a Swiss arms 4×40 scope, and his secondary weapon is a Tokyo Marui Hi-capa 5.1 semi-automatic airsoft pistol. It’s fun to watch the videos, but I was thinking it would be more fun to start playing the sport too.
