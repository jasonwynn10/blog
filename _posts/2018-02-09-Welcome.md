I've decided to start a blog about whatever's on my mind while posting, and I also hope to be starting a series on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl_WphG9GGEwBKPQcdSPwTA) which will correspond to some of the posts I make.

Blogging will be a first for me, so I figured I should try to get into it and make some decent content. I'll post periodically at first, but I may create a posting schedule for another time. As was previously stated, I've decided to post these blogs when I post a video to youtube.

Thanks for anyone who's giving support. I'll try to create good YouTube content for you too.
