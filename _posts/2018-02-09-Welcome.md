I've decided to start a blog about programming and PocketMine plugin development. I also hope to be starting a series on YouTube which will run in correspondence with the posts I make here.

Blogging will be a first for me, so I figured I should try to get into it and make some decent content. I'll post periodically, and I may create a posting schedule for another time, but as I'm learning how to do this properly, I've decided to post the blogs when I post a video to youtube.

Thanks for anyone who's giving support. I'll try to create good YouTube content for you too.
