title: A New Computer
---
I recently gathered all but one the parts to build my own gaming computer. The system is much better than my current setup by a long shot. It has an Intel i5 CPU, NVIDIA GTX 1060 Graphics card, Gigabyte Gaming 5 Motherboard, Thermaltake case, one 4 Terabyte hard drive, two 320 gigabyte hard drives, a 270 gigabyte solid state drive, and an Intel Optane Memory m.2 SSD. This computer has enough power to do what I want with it, and thereâ€™s still a lot of room for upgrades. The final peice I need to finish it is some DDR4 RAM.
