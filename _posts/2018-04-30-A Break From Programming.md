title: A Break From Programming
---
I've been asked to halt my efforts in developing my skills with programming because it is distracting me from my course work.  I know what they mean and agree that it has been slowing my learning speed, so I will be leaving the development community for a few months.  I will still update my own projects with patches periodically to keep them functioning properly.
