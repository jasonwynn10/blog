After the first post to this blog, which I uploaded at the start of february, I have not posted since.
I have been caught up in helping my famiy earn money in order to send my sister to France for the next school year as a foreign exchange student. So far, we have only collected enough funds to secure her a seat on the plane, and more money will be needed to completely pay for her year as a foreign exchange student.

Her GoFundMe is at https://www.gofundme.com/help-me-go-to-france-for-a-year and all donations are very much appreciated! Thanks for the support!
